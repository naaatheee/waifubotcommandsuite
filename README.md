# Now defunct, WaifuBot is dead.

# waifubotcommandsuite
A bunch of simple AHK scripts that help issue commands to Waifubot.

For all scripts, make sure to keep the Discord server you want the script to output to as the main window.
The default prefix this script uses is the "." prefix (e.g: .claim Kaguya Shinomiya), edit the script to use the prefix that's set on your server.

# Waifubot interaction script
Before use, edit the script and change the "waifus" variable to the maximum number shown on your list.

Default keys are
CTRL + F8 to start the script
CTRL + F9 to pause the script

# Waifubot spawning script

Default keys are
CTRL + F10 to start the spawning script
CTRL + F11 to pause the script
CTRL + F12 to terminate the script

# Full Waifu list script
Before use, edit the script and change the "pages" variable to the maximum number of pages that your collection has.

The script will automatically delete your ".list" commands to maintain a uniform look, do not be alarmed if dialog boxes pop up asking to delete messages.

Default keys are
CTRL + F6 to start the script
CTRL + F7 to pause the script
